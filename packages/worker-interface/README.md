# WorkerInterface

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/burdiuz/js-worker-interface/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/burdiuz/js-worker-interface?branch=master)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/burdiuz/js-worker-interface.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/burdiuz/js-worker-interface)

WorkerInterface allows exposing Worker API and calling it from host application as fields and methods of an object.

From Worker side:

```javascript
import { initializeWorker } from '@actualwave/worker-interface';

const api = initializeWorker({
  worker: self,
  root: {
    myMethod: (...args) => {
      return 'Something to return';
    },
  },
});
```

From host application side:

```javascript
import { initializeHost } from '@actualwave/worker-interface';

// initialize functions always return Promise, it resolves when handshake completed.
const api = await initializeHost({
  worker: new Worker('./worker.js'),
});

// api.root is a mirror of "root" object from Worker
// result always returned in a Promise
const result = await api.root.myMethod();

console.log('RESULT:', result); // Something to return
```

> Communcation is possible the other way around -- if "root" object is set for host application, it could be used within Worker.

## Resources

Worker Interface is capable of sending any types of simple serializable data -- any primitive data type, instances of Object and Array. Also it has a special way of sending custom objects that have, for example methods or non-iterable properties. To send such an object to other side(host > worker or worker > host) it should be registered as a resource in ResourcePool and then resource object is being sent.

```javascript
const privateAPI = {
  secretData() {
    return 'Aliens are real!';
  },
};

const api =  WorkerInterface.initializeWorker({
  worker: self,
  root: {
    async getPrivateAPI(secret) {
      if (secret !== 'password1') {
        return null;
      }

      const { pool } = await api;

      // register privateAPI as a Resource
      const resource = pool.set(privateAPI);

      // return Resource object, send it to host
      return resource.toObject();
    },
  },
});
```

When resource is received, it will be wrapped into a Proxy object which will translate any type of accessing its properties/methods into commands to access these properties on original object and return result back into invoking side.

```javascript
workerApi = await WorkerInterface.initializeHost({
  worker: './webworker.js',
});
const { root: api } = workerApi;

// Receive a resource from Worker
const secretApi = api.getPrivateAPI('password1');

// Call method on Resource
const secretData = await secretApi.secretData();
```

> ResourcePool is built using [WeakRef](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakRef)'s and once target object is dereferenced and destroyed with Garbage Collector, it will not be accessible anymore.

## Example

This repo contains working example, for [browser](https://github.com/burdiuz/js-deferred-data-access/tree/master/examples/worker-interface) and [nodejs](https://github.com/burdiuz/js-deferred-data-access/blob/master/testing/worker-interface-test.js). To start browser example, run `npm install`, `npm start` and then visit `http://localhost:8081/`.
